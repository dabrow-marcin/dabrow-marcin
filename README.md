:wave: Hello there, my name is Marcin and this is my personal workspace, an outlet for my creativity and personal side projects. I was kind of born with a keyboard in my hands, computers were always of huge importance to me. Being obsessed with video games led to taking interest in programming .. and here I am two decades later!

 

:books: I am not your run-of-the mill programmer, my background is actually in special needs education which I have a bachelor degree in. I also worked as a special ed teacher/therapist. For many reasons I decided to switch my careers, but the passion for psychology and need to help others is still burning inside of me. I find a lot of joy in mentoring and passing knowledge to other people.

 

:computer: Currently I'm a software developer with over 6 years of professional experience in developing, testing and maintaining various software, from low level hadware integrations to high level message processing software. I focus mosly on .NET but I am learning new stuff which will be reflected in this repository. I led a development team of seven people for a year, I took part in sales meetings with potential customers, and helped companies with hiring (as technical interviewer). On weekends I'm also working as a Programming Trainer in a bootcamp style academy, where I teach programming to people who want to get into the industry.
